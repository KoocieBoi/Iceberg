## Info

hello there! this is, i hope, the best of all my bots that i've surrendered over the time. i want to add a lot of useful and fun features. i do not plan to launch this bot as a public bot. you're completely free to suggest features or signal issues in the issues tab and to fork the repository and submit a PR. :)

- `Y` marks that minor changes or features were made
- `Z` marks bugfixes
- `DDMMYY` marks the day, month and year of the change
